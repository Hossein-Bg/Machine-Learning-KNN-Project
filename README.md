# KNN Classifier

The KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) classifier is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It is a non-parametric algorithm, meaning it does not make assumptions about the distribution of the data, and it works by finding the K nearest neighbors to a given data point in the feature space and classifying the data point based on the majority class of its K nearest neighbors.

## Requirements

To use the KNN Classifier, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine, along with the following libraries:

* numpy
* sklearn

You can install these libraries using pip, by running the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy sklearn
```

## Usage

To use the KNN Classifier, you will need to create an instance of the KNeighborsClassifier class from the sklearn.neighbors module, and then fit the classifier to your training data using the fit method. Once the classifier has been trained, you can use the predict method to make predictions on new data points.

Here's an example of how to use the KNN Classifier:

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
import numpy as np

# create some training data
X_train = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]])
y_train = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])

# create a KNN Classifier with k=3
clf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)

# train the classifier on the training data
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# make a prediction on a new data point
X_test = np.array([[2, 3]])
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

print(y_pred)

```
In this example, we create some training data consisting of 4 data points with 2 features each, and 2 classes. We then create a KNN Classifier with k=3, fit the classifier to the training data, and make a prediction on a new data point with features [2, 3].

The output of the predict method in this case will be the predicted class of the new data point, which is 0.

## Parameters

The KNN Classifier has several parameters that you can tune to optimize its performance for your specific use case. Some of the most important parameters are:

* n_neighbors: the number of neighbors to use for classification (default=5).
* weights: the weight function used in prediction. Possible values are 'uniform' (all neighbors are weighted equally) or 'distance' (closer neighbors are weighted more heavily) (default='uniform').
* algorithm: the algorithm used to compute nearest neighbors. Possible values are 'brute' (use brute force to compute distances between all pairs of points), 'kd_tree' (use a KD-tree to speed up distance computations), or 'ball_tree' (use a ball tree to speed up distance computations) (default='auto').
* metric: the distance metric used to compute distances between points. Possible values are any of the metrics supported by scikit-learn, such as 'euclidean', 'manhattan', or 'cosine' (default='minkowski').

You can tune these parameters by passing them to the KNeighborsClassifier constructor. For example:

```bash
clf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5, weights='distance', algorithm='kd_tree', metric='euclidean')
```

## Conclusion

The KNN Classifier is a simple yet powerful algorithm for classification tasks. By finding the K nearest neighbors to a given data point, it can make accurate predictions on new data points with high accuracy. By tuning its parameters, you can optimize
